# GitHub Actions CI/CD Setup Instructions

This document provides instructions on setting up secrets required for the CI/CD pipeline.

## Required Secrets

You need to add these secrets to your GitHub repository for the CI/CD pipeline to work properly:

1. `DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME`: Your Docker Hub username
2. `DOCKER_HUB_ACCESS_TOKEN`: Your Docker Hub access token (not your password)

For deployment, you will also need (once enabled in the workflow):
1. `SERVER_HOST`: The host/IP address of your server
2. `SERVER_USERNAME`: SSH username for your server
3. `SERVER_SSH_KEY`: SSH private key for authentication

## Setting Up Secrets in GitHub

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on "Settings" tab
3. In the left sidebar, click on "Secrets and variables" â†’ "Actions"
4. Click "New repository secret"
5. Add each secret with its appropriate value

## Creating a Docker Hub Access Token

1. Log in to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/)
2. Click on your username and go to "Account Settings"
3. Go to "Security" section
4. Click "New Access Token"
5. Give it a name (e.g., "GitHub Actions") and set appropriate permissions
6. Copy the token immediately (it will only be shown once)
7. Add this token as the `DOCKER_HUB_ACCESS_TOKEN` secret in GitHub

## Setting Up SSH Keys for Deployment

1. Generate a new SSH key pair (if you don't have one):
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f github-actions-deploy -C "github-actions-deploy"
   ```
2. Add the public key (github-actions-deploy.pub) to the authorized_keys file on your server
3. Add the private key (github-actions-deploy) content as the `SERVER_SSH_KEY` secret in GitHub

## Enabling Deployment

The deployment job is commented out by default in the workflow. Once you've set up all required secrets, you can uncomment the deployment section in `.github/workflows/django-ci.yml`.
